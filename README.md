# Cost-of-living-Comparison-
Cost of living comparison from Basel worker perspective living in Basel, Freiburg or Colmar.    
A complete ETL process as part of the Data Collection, Integration and Pre-processing course. 
  
The high cost of leaving and the constant increase in rental prices in Switzerland leads people to look for alternative accommodation options. The unique feature of Basel city, located at the corner of three countries, allows people to look for rental apartments not only within the country borders, but also in the nearby cities in France and Germany, in the hope for better accommodations.  
In this project we will gather data from three different rental agency websites, located in Switzerland, France and Germany. For a better comparison we will examine the rental prices in three major cities located within an hour from each other: Basel (CH), Colmar (FR) and Freiburg (DE).
